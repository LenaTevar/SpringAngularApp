# Spring Angular App

 Trying to get how to use Angular as frontend and Java Spring as backend.

## Frontend

- Angular cli : todo

## Backend

- rest-web-services - Java Spring MVC project

## Important

I have only 1 day to do this and is for research purposes, so expected to be
abandoned until needed.
